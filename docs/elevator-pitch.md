# Quorum — Elevator Pitch

**Gathering potential.**

We're lonelier and more disconnected than ever. The antidote is simple — gather in person. But the tools we have make it needlessly difficult. Scheduling polls create endless back-and-forth that rarely resolves. They optimize for consensus — trying to find the one time that works for everyone — and events die in planning limbo. None of them think about where.

Quorum takes a fundamentally different approach. Instead of asking "when can everyone make it?", Quorum asks "when can *enough* people make it?" Set a minimum attendance threshold, and when enough people say yes, the gathering locks in. No more waiting for stragglers. And when demand exceeds capacity, overflow sessions spin up automatically from remaining availability.

At its core, Quorum treats locations as first-class participants. Venues have schedules too — whether you control the space or it's a public resource, Quorum integrates location availability directly into the scheduling process, matching people, times, and places across all three dimensions at once.

Whether you're organizing a one-off workshop, a recurring book club, or a multi-session community series, Quorum gets the right people in the right room at the right time — with the least effort possible.

Quorum is the first app on Platopia — a platform for organizing group experiences.

## How It Works

1. **Create** — Host describes the gathering: title, duration, quorum threshold, capacity
2. **Invite** — Share a link. Invitees rank their preferred times and locations with minimal friction
3. **Confirm** — Quorum met? The gathering locks in. Excess demand spins up new sessions automatically

Behind the scenes, Quorum cross-references people, schedules, and venue availability to surface the best possible options — so hosts don't have to.

## Venue Intelligence

**Today:** Hosts connect spaces they control — a living room, a community center, a coworking space — and Quorum manages their availability, automatically reserving slots when gatherings confirm.

**Next:** Quorum expands into public spaces, starting with library meeting rooms in select cities. Every branch uses different booking software. Our agentic AI navigates each system — discovering available rooms, comparing options, and booking automatically.

**Future:** A robust venue network where spaces of all kinds are discoverable, bookable, and integrated into every scheduling decision.

## AI in the Background, Humans in the Room

Quorum is AI-native — not because we want to talk about AI, but because it makes things possible that weren't before. As complexity grows, the scheduling engine handles it. AI optimizes slot selection, predicts attendance patterns, suggests configurations, and books venues across disparate systems.

The technology is invisible. The gatherings are real.
