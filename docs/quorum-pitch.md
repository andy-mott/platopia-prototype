# Quorum

**Gathering potential.**

Smart scheduling that brings groups together — effortlessly.

---

## The Problem: Organizing group events is broken

1. Scheduling polls create endless back-and-forth with no resolution
2. No tool considers venue availability alongside people's schedules
3. Events die in planning because organizers wait for 100% consensus that never comes

---

## Our Approach: Simple for everyone, no matter the complexity

Whether it's a quick meetup that fills up on any day, or distributing 200 people from multiple time zones into 15 different limited series — virtual, in-person, or hybrid — the experience stays frictionless.

We require minimum input through intuitive interfaces and abstract the complexity through smart code and AI-enabled scheduling.

| Simple | → | Complex |
|---|---|---|
| A quick team meetup | | 200 people · 15 series · 5 time zones |

**Same effortless experience for hosts and participants at every scale.**

## The Solution: Quorum solves this in three ways

### Quorum-based confirmation
Events lock in when enough people say yes, not when everyone responds. Set your threshold and go.

### Locations as participants
Venues have availability too. Quorum matches people, times, and places together automatically.

### Overflow gatherings
Too much demand? Additional sessions spin up automatically from remaining slots.

## How It Works

1. **Create** — Host describes the gathering, sets quorum and capacity thresholds
2. **Schedule** — Host picks potential dates, times, and locations
3. **Match** — System cross-references to find viable options across all three dimensions
4. **Invite** — Invitees rank their top preferences with minimal friction
5. **Confirm** — Quorum met — host reviews results and locks in the gathering
6. **Overflow** — Excess demand? New sessions offered from remaining availability

## Where This Is Going

### Automatic space discovery and booking
Quorum will discover and book available spaces automatically — starting with public resources like library meeting rooms, where every branch uses different scheduling software. Our agentic AI handles the complexity of navigating each system so the host doesn't have to.

### AI-powered scheduling intelligence
As complexity grows — more people, more time zones, more constraints — the scheduling engine gets smarter. AI optimizes slot selection, predicts attendance patterns, and suggests configurations that maximize participation.
