# Quorum

**Gathering potential.**

Smart scheduling that brings groups together — effortlessly.

## The Problem: Getting people in a room together shouldn't be this hard

We're lonelier and more disconnected than ever. The antidote is simple — gather in person. But the tools we have make it needlessly difficult.

Scheduling polls like Doodle and When2meet create endless back-and-forth that rarely resolves. They optimize for consensus — trying to find the one time that works for everyone — which means events die in planning limbo waiting for responses that never come.

And none of them think about where. Venue availability is a whole separate problem — navigating coworking space calendars, library booking systems, or just texting a friend who has a living room. People and places are coordinated in parallel, by hand, by the host.

*It doesn't have to be this way.*

## Our Insight: Most gatherings don't need everyone — they need enough people

Traditional scheduling tools ask: "When can everyone make it?" Quorum asks: "When can *enough* people make it?"

This is a fundamentally different model. Instead of optimizing for consensus, Quorum optimizes for participation — getting the most people into actual gatherings, not stuck in polling purgatory.

## The Solution: Quorum brings together people, times, and places

### Quorum-based confirmation
Set a minimum attendance threshold. When enough people say yes, the gathering locks in — no more waiting for stragglers. And no one gets left behind: when a gathering fills to capacity, overflow sessions spin up automatically from remaining availability.

### Locations as a first-class dimension
Venues have schedules too. Whether you control the space or it's a public resource, Quorum integrates location availability directly into the scheduling process — matching people, times, and places across all three dimensions at once.

### Radically simple for everyone
We require minimum input through intuitive interfaces and shift the complexity burden from humans to software. Whether it's a quick meetup or 200 people across 15 sessions and 5 time zones — the experience stays frictionless for hosts and participants alike.

## How It Works

1. **Create** — Host describes the gathering: title, duration, quorum threshold, capacity
2. **Invite** — Share a link. Invitees rank their preferred times and locations with minimal friction
3. **Confirm** — Quorum met? The gathering locks in. Excess demand spins up new sessions automatically

Behind the scenes, Quorum cross-references people, schedules, and venue availability to surface the best possible options — so hosts don't have to.

## Venue Intelligence

Quorum treats spaces as active participants in the scheduling process.

**Today:** Hosts can connect spaces they control — a living room, a community center, a coworking space — and Quorum manages their availability, automatically reserving slots when gatherings confirm.

**Next:** Quorum expands into public spaces, starting with library meeting rooms in select cities. Every branch uses different booking software. Our agentic AI navigates each system so the host doesn't have to — discovering available rooms, comparing options, and booking automatically.

**Future:** A robust venue network where spaces of all kinds — libraries, coworking hubs, community centers, private studios — are discoverable, bookable, and integrated into every scheduling decision.

## AI in the Background, Humans in the Room

Quorum is AI-native — not because we want to talk about AI, but because it makes things possible that weren't before. As complexity grows — more people, more time zones, more constraints — the scheduling engine handles it. AI optimizes slot selection, predicts attendance patterns, suggests configurations, and books venues across disparate systems.

*The technology is invisible. The gatherings are real.*

## Where This Is Going

Quorum is the first app on Platopia — a platform for organizing group experiences. It's our proof of concept for a broader ecosystem where getting people together is the easy part, not the hard part.

### Coming soon

- Calendar integration with popular platforms — availability informs options automatically
- Multi-timezone coordination for distributed groups with co-hosts
- Recurring and limited series that adapt as schedules shift
- Expanded venue network across cities
